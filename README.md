# Manjaro-Package_cleaner
A simple bash script for cleaning packages in Manjaro Linux or Other Arch based linux distros [including ARCH Linux :) ]

In Linux distributions, a **“package”** refers to a compressed file archive containing all of the files that come with a particular application.It is like **setup files** on windows.

**Note1:** This script will not remove any applications but it will remove their setup files.

**Note2:** ![Pamac](https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Pamac) should be installed on your distro.It is pre-installed on Manjaro.

Download the **![Package_cleaner.sh](https://github.com/Ashutosh-Kukreti/Manjaro-Package_cleaner/releases)** file.
You can run the script using following commands:

>./Package_cleaner.sh

**Note:** To use this command script should have exceutable permissions.

**OR**

>Package_cleaner.sh

I don't have much programming knowledge but if you have any suggestions for the script please feel free to share.
