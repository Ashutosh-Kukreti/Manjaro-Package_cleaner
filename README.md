# Manjaro-Package_cleaner
A simple bash script for cleaning packages in Manjaro Linux or Other Arch based linux distros [including ARCH Linux :) ]

Download the **Package_cleaner.sh** file.
You can run the script using following commands:

>./Package_cleaner.sh

**Note:** This command requires that you give excecutable permissions to the script.

**OR**

>Package_cleaner.sh

**Screenshots:**

I don't have much programming knowledge but if you have any suggestions for the script please feel free to share.
